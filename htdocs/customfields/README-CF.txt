=================================================

===== DESCRIPTION =====

This module will enable the user to create custom fields for the supported modules. You can choose the datatype, the size, the label(s), the possible values, the value by default, and even constraints (links to other tables) and custom sql definitions and custom sql statements!

CustomFields has been made with the intention of being as portable, flexible, modular and reusable as possible, so that it can be adapted to any Dolibarr's module, and to (almost) any user's need (even if something isn't implemented, you can most probably just use a custom sql statement, the rest will be managed automatically, even with custom statements!).

===== DOWNLOAD =====

For developpers wanting to extend CustomFields or implementers wanting to use CustomFields to its fullest potential, a full description of the API can be found here:
http://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Module_CustomFields_Dev

For concrete examples of CustomFields implementations, you can find a list of tutorials here:
http://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Module_CustomFields_Cases

===== INSTALL =====

Just as any Dolibarr's module, just unzip the contents of this package inside your dolibarr's folder (you should be asked to overwrite some files if done right).

You can also place CustomFields in the htdocs/custom/ folder, it should work correctly but if you encounter weird issues (like ajax cascading not working), you should try to place CustomFields directly in the root htdocs/ folder instead of htdocs/custom/.
